Introduction to the double metaphor.
 
Abstract: A formal representation of Hell & a closure through faith.
 
This one aim to give a accurate representation of hell:
its layer, mechanism in a axiomatic way.

assumption: it is assume as self evident that

    * hell has 3 layer namely H_4, H_3, H_2

We gonna work on representations:
    a state with no corruption will be written as 0
    a state with    corruption will be written as X
 
 
 
chapter 1: Hell is a frightening place
#########
 
Following are 2D representations, they are chosen as canonical.
 
 
representing H_4
 
    X   X       0   X       0   0       0   0
 
 
    X   X       X   X       X   X       X   0
 
    H_4,4       H_4,3       H_4,2       H_4,1
 
representing H_3
 
        X               0               X
 
 
    X       X       X       X       0       0      
 
      H_3,3           H_3,2           H_3,1
 
representing H_2
 
    X       X               0       X
 
      H_2,2                   H_2,1
 
 
Why these representations are undoubtedly wrong:
    Where the degree of corruption is maximum (H_4,4, H_3,3, H_2,2) lies abomination, no hope at all.
    It is self-evident that Jesus can/could/would do something about it
    We then have to had another component to each layer but those are invisible to the unfaithful.

Chapter 3: H_3+ is a fully closable stage
##########
 
With this representations in mind question can be asked,
we've done something similar that what has been done with Euler's theorem on polyhedrons,
but instead of adding blindness we had vision in the darkest places.
 
Let's do a bit of geometry: starting with the number 3 for simplicity
 
H_3+ has 4 components:
 
We can remark that with a negation of all states
    stages H_3,3 & H_3,0 are in relation
    stages H_3,2 & H_3,1 are in relation
We call that relation between stages dual, we remark that no stage of H_3+ are self dual
from this point of view H_3+ is "closed stage".
 
On the other hand, if we permute states of any stage of H_3+, the shape will always be the same.
 
Theorem on H_3+:
    H_3+ is globally stable by permutation of its stages (triangle to triangle)
    No self dual in H_3+.
 
Those two properties are gold, we just want to achieve the same with other layers namely H_4 & H_2.
 
Proposition on H_2+: globally stable with a self dual
    H_2+ is globally stable by permutation of its stages (segment to segment)
    There is self dual in H_2+: H_2,1 is it's own dual
 
Proposition on H_4+: not globally stable with a self dual
    H_4+ is not globally stable by permutation of its stages (lost convexity possible)
    There is self dual in H_4+: H_4,2 is it's own dual
 
Chapter 4: Study of H_2 & H_4,2

0       X                   0       X  
           
  H_2,1      its symmetry       .
 
                            X       0
 
 
 
 
 
0       0                   0       0
       
       
X       X                   X       X
   
H_4,2       its symmetry        .
 
                            X       X
 
 
                            0       0
 
#mmmm this last object can be viewed as a 3D object, with a bit of change of perspective we can have
 
 0      X
0      X
         
    .
 X      0
X      0   
 
and with a perfect alignment: that's H_2,1 and it's symmetry
 
0       X
 
    .
 
X       0
 
we have a relation ! but it's implying central symmetry and not negation ....
Plus this relation involve passing from 2D representation to 3D ...
 
Chapter 5 : Negation is such a pitiful aka concept 2D/3D bridging
###########
 
Let's take a moment to rethink our H_3+ introducing 3D
 
    0       0       0       0  
 
 
        0               X
 
        .               .              
 
        X               0               X           #           0
                                                    #
                                                    #
    X       X       X       X       0       0       #       0       0
                                                    #
      H_3,3           H_3,2           H_3,1         #         H_3,0
 
 
 
A new relation:
    starting from a 2D environment; with a rotation of Pi,
    continuing in 3D a central symmetry and a negation of all states
        stages H_3,3 & H_3,0 are in relation
        stages H_3,2 & H_3,1 are in relation
We call that relation between stages dual, the previous definition was shit
  And the previous reasoning still holds: Theorem on H_3+, Proposition on H_2+, Proposition on H_4+.
 
Chapter 6 : forcing H_2+ and H_4+
###########
 
Wen can not achieve the goal of closing  H_2 & H_4 separately,
we gonna associated them attacking the weak point which is the 2 auto dual H_2,1 & H_4,2
 
As they are similar, see #4, with 2D/3D bridging,
We will use H_2,1 as a representation of H_4,2.
But this will relation will be hidden on the following diagram,
This will be achieved using H_2,1 and it's symmetry
 
We add lines for easy visualization, (needed to illustrate convexity loss)
 
Part 1: closing H_4+ without H_4,2 via H_2,1:

    H_4,4       H_4,3               H_4,1       H_4,0
 
 
Part 2: closing H_2+ without H_2,1 via H_4,2:
    The consequence of the hidden relation is that H_2,2 and H_0,0 will not be dual one of another
    Convexity has to kick back in.
 
 
            0----0                  0----0
            |    |                    \/

            X----X                  X----X
 
 
Realize that the two last diagram are one an unique object and forget
H_2,1 and it's symmetry in the part 1.
 
We have the expected result with not a central symmetry thought a point,
but this time we just align with H_2,1 and it's symmetry in the part 1
 
Cardinality
-----------
 
half closed H_4+ part 1 = 12 (1 is hidden) => 13
half closed H_2+ part 2 = 2  (1 is hidden) =>  3
 
Closed H_4+ U H_2+ = 24
